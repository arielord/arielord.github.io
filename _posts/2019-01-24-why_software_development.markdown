My interest wildly varied from natural sciences, business, math, and to computers. I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do or what I wanted to major in. My interests did seem to lean towards STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) fields and with that I was off. Joined many STEM related programs and extracurricular groups. All of these programs heavily promoted undergraduate research experiences (or better known as REU’s). I’ve never really heard of them, but was quickly intrigued by past students experience and research posters. With the Spring semester approaching I was adamantly applying for these research experiences. Almost felt like a lost cause being a freshman. I mean, I barely had a foundation with my one semester’s worth of coursework. Against all odds I was able to land a mathematics REU.

By the time my internship started in the summer I was actually getting interested in computer science itself. With that in mind, I spent a lot of my time learning how to program. My contributions for the project were primarily code documentation which I was more than happy to do, but the internship did have longer lasting influence on me. That REU showed me the interesting parts of math and how much coding is actually involved. Seemed like a very versatile skillset and I decided to major in it. The following year I was able to do an independent research project which I ultimately decided to create a mobile application for the project that showed points of interests for new students. My last summer at university was actually an REU at a cancer institute. I was apparently a good fit with my previous research experience and mathematics background. The project itself was to recreate a surgical procedure using virtual reality. This meant there was a lot of coding involved for me.

So why software development? I realized before starting university that, software is absolutely everywhere. From our phones, to our televisions, our appliances, and most obviously our computers. I felt that in order to truly understand the world around us that I would need to learn about software development. I suppose that train of thought just stuck with me because, I just kept going back to code. Every internship I did I found my way back to coding. Looking back now, it was definitely the most fun I had during my classes/internships. I just liked solving problems, but unlike mathematics I got instant feedback and was able to show it off.
