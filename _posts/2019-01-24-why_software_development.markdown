Why software development? The answer for me personally is actually quite simple, I sort of just "stumbled" into it. The real question is, how did I happen to stumble and get absorbed into this beautiful world of coding?

It all began shortly before my first semester of university. I've already had countless nights where I would just stay up till dawn looking at different majors and their respective career prospects. I was unable to make up my mind so my research continued. It was one of those nights I was still going at it, but I needed a break. There I went and started up a game on my computer while still leisurely continuing my research on the my second screen. That's when it hit me, the world is actually being ran by software. Still amazes me now how long it took to for me to figure that out, but that night, it just all made sense. Had a browser open on one screen, a game on another, and then looked down on my phone with it's multitude of applications. At that point, the only thought left in my head was "Our world is all software". At this point I knew absolutely nothing about software development and made a little pact with myself to delve into it.

With my little pact in mind I enrolled into some computer science courses throughout the years, but never fully commited to a computer science major. I did ultimately choose biological sciences as my major since that is where my interests lied most heavily based off of my high school experience. Funny thing about high school experiences is that, they don't tend to align with your college experience. So that biology (intended) major status did not last very long. Four years later and here I am with a mathematics degree. Something people don't tell you is that mathematics requires quite a bit of coding. Which was extremely conevenient for me as I had taken those intro level computer science courses. Better yet with the computer sciences classes I was taking throughout the years in addition to the math classes, I ended up with a computational mathematics degree.

Post graduation I felt like I was on top of the world. Attained a versatile degree in mathematics and surprisingly did hold up my end of the bargain of learning about software. Reflecting on my time at university I realized even in my math classes the most satisfying part was being able to get my code to successfully run/compile. It is truly one of the most gratifying things, and if you have ever coded I am pretty sure you know the feeling. With this in mind I was determined to find a job in software development and advance my skill set from scripting to building actual applications.

It was never really my plan to go into software development and it wasn't my plan nor did I major in computer science. Like I said I just continously stumbled into it and I liked it.
