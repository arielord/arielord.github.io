Here I am blasting through my SQL, ActiveRecord, and Sinatra lessons feeling unstoppable. This pace comes to a screeching halt once that Sinatra portfolio project pops up. I immediately get started on it once I finalized my idea, and to my surprise have created most of the logic for the main model of my application. Two months pass and I realized I have made absolutely no progress on this project, but why? DISTRACTIONS!!!

Now I'm not very proud of this scenario, but I did learn a lot from it. When you're working on something that is not a lesson but a full blown project with dozens of files and moving parts you realize you need a lot of uninterrupted time. Losing your train of thought can be very detrimental when working with a somewhat large code base if it is not deliberate. I was in a very unfortunate position where I was constantly being interrupted primarily by family and work obligations. While not exactly avoidable there were some things I could have done to minimize the halt in progress of my projects.

First off, do not be afraid to start over. After two months I found it easier to start from scratch than continuing on what I have already built. I also realized I was able to group my logic better the second time through and it heavily improved the readability of my code. Two, adjust your schedule or use some of your me time. While I can't control if you're an early bird or a night owl what I have realized is people gravitate to one or the other so they can have some alone time. That time is usually reserved for television, videos, or just endlessly staring at your cell phone. Whil eyou should still reserve some time for yourself and the thigns you enjoy these are actuallyu perfect times to work on your projects because these are the times you will likely get the least distractions. I mean you already knew that which is why you're watching your favorite shows at 2 in the morning! And lastly, have fun with it! My rhymebot project did necessarily lend itself well to the Sinatra project requirements, but I was really keen on it and really wanted it. I had to do some funky work arounds like an ultimately unneeded login and signup page, but it did add some interesting twist and turns to the project.

Hope these tips help someone and happy coding!
